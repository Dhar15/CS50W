### Project 3 - Mail 

### OVERVIEW 

#### This project aims at designing a front-end for an email client that makes API calls to send and receive emails. <br/> The project focuses purely on using JavaScript to fetch the API query to send/recieve the mails.

#### <ins> Functionalities- </ins>
1. `Send Mail` Users can compose a mail to send, providing the recipient email id, subject and body.
2. `Mailbox` Users have three mailboxes : Inbox, Sent and Archive. The inbox loads all the recieved and unarchived emails. The Sent mailbox includes all the emails sent by user.
3. `Archive/Unarchive` We can archive a mail to remove a mail from inbox and transfer to the archive mailbox. We can also choose to unarchive it later.
4. `Reply Mail` We can reply to any mail we recieved.
