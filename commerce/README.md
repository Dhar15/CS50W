### Project 0 - Commerce 

### OVERVIEW 

#### This project aims at designing an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”

#### <ins> Functionalities - </ins>
1) Create Listing - Users can visit a new page to create a listing of their choice. They must provide a title, description, starting bid and optionally, an image URL.
2) Active Listings - Users can view all the listings currently on the auction site. 
3) View Listing - Users can select a particular listing to find out the details about it. They can view all information about the listing including who listed it, and the category it belongs to.
4) Place Bid - A user who wishes to buy an item can proceed to bid on it. If it is the highest bid, the page will necessarily change to display the same.
5) Close Bid - Owner can choose to close the bidding of any item he had listed. Once closed, no more bidding can take place for that product. The winner of that bid would be notified about their win.
6) Add to Watchlist - A user can add items to his watchlist if they wish to review it later, and can similarly remove an item from watchlist.
7) Comments - Users can add comments on any listing giving reviews, which get displayed on the page along with all the present reviews.
